    question: "How is this different from a placement agent?",
    answer: "Placement agents are expensive (1-3% of capital) and use a pre-existing network. We help you build *your own* asset and pipeline at a flat fee, giving you control and long-term scalability."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of ROI can I expect?",
    answer: "If a new investor brings just $25k in lifetime fees and calls cost $500, closing at a measly 10% yields a 5x ROI. We'll map your specific potential ROI during our strategy session."
  },
  {
    question: "How long until I see results?",
    answer: "Our system is built for speed. After a 14 day build-out, you can expect qualified investor calls on your calendar within 30 days of launch."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with my asset class?",
    answer: "We work with multifamily, self-storage, industrial, VC, and more. The principles of targeting accredited investors are universal across these asset classes."
